# SGporecondensation
Small repository containing the relevant simulation and analysis code for stress-granule condensation at pore damaged vesicles. For the study of plugging effects.

## Simulation note
We recommend using the LAMMPS version from November 3rd 2022 or a later one. The ylz potential (which is not present in older versions) is required for these simulations.

## Analysis note
For the analysis performed the surface reconstruction library developped by Miguel Amaral (Saric lab) is required. This is freely available at https://github.com/Saric-Group/monolayer_shared
